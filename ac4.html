Objective: <br>
The objective of this project was to integrate Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with network management to develop decision support tools for municipal infrastructure managers. Specifically, the project aimed to assist in prioritizing infrastructure maintenance, capital renewal, identifying locations for new Overhead Tanks (OHT), and ensuring frequent water supply within the Thoothukudi City water distribution network.
 <br>
Methodology: <br>

Geographic Information System (GIS) Framework: <br>

Utilized GIS as the framework to store, manage, analyze, manipulate, and display spatially linked data.
Obtained and analyzed the water distribution network data of Thoothukudi City.
Incorporated spatial and non-spatial asset risk variables for 30 Overhead Tanks and 8 Pumpsets Boosters in Thoothukudi City Corporation, considering water sources such as river and well water. <br>
Data Analysis and Computation: <br>

Collected data on Thoothukudi's distribution networks, including friction factor, unit head loss, pressure, head, and elevation.
Utilized EPANET software to compute the necessary parameters for the analysis.
Analyzed the flow of water throughout the network to identify areas with potential water shortage or inadequate pressure. <br>
New OHT Location Analysis: <br>

Identified the need for a new water supply tank and analyzed suitable locations within the network.
Assessed the flow of water and potential areas of water scarcity, considering the daily usage of water within the network. <br>
Infrastructure Improvement and Pressure Optimization: <br>

Evaluated the existing infrastructure to identify areas that require improvement to achieve desired pressure levels.
Considered an assumed internal diameter of 40mm for the entire network to ensure pressure compatibility.
<br>
Results and Recommendations: <br>

Obtained results indicating areas with water shortage and the recommended locations for new OHTs.
Identified the need for infrastructure improvements and pressure optimization strategies.
Highlighted the daily water usage on the campus and proposed solutions, such as water pumps in specific locations, to address water scarcity issues. <br>
Conclusion: <br>
The Water Distribution Network Mapping project successfully integrated GIS with network management techniques to analyze and improve the water distribution system in Thoothukudi City. By utilizing GIS tools, spatial data analysis, and EPANET computation, the project provided insights into water flow, identified areas of water scarcity, and recommended new OHT locations. The project's outcomes served as decision support tools for municipal infrastructure managers, facilitating prioritization of maintenance activities, capital renewal, and ensuring frequent water supply to meet the needs of the city's population.
