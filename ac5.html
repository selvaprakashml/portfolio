Objective: <br>
The objective of this project was to map the forest fire risk zones in the Kangaroo Island region of Australia in December 2019. The study area was classified into five regions based on burn severity levels: Unburned, Low Severity, Moderate – Low Severity, Moderate – High Severity, and High Severity. The project aimed to assess the impact of fire intensity on the ecosystem and provide valuable data for emergency rehabilitation and restoration planning post-fire. Additionally, the project aimed to estimate the likelihood of future downstream impacts such as flooding, landslides, and soil erosion.
 <br>
Methodology: <br>

Data Collection: <br>

Gathered burn severity data and maps for the Kangaroo Island region from reliable sources such as satellite imagery, aerial surveys, and ground observations.
Identified and classified the study area into five distinct regions based on the severity levels of the fire. <br>
Burn Severity Analysis: <br>

Analyzed the burn severity data to understand how the fire intensity affected the functioning of the ecosystem in the burnt areas.
Assessed the extent and severity of the fire impact, taking into consideration factors such as vegetation damage, soil burn severity, and ecosystem disruption. <br>
Risk Zone Mapping: <br>

Utilized GIS software and spatial analysis techniques to map the forest fire risk zones in the Kangaroo Island region.
Classified the study area into different risk zones based on the burn severity levels, indicating the likelihood and potential impact of future fire events. <br>
Post-Fire Rehabilitation and Restoration Planning: <br>

Utilized the burn severity data and risk zone maps to develop emergency rehabilitation and restoration plans.
Identified areas with high burn severity and potential downstream impacts to prioritize mitigation efforts and plan for measures to prevent flooding, landslides, and soil erosion. <br>
Reporting and Recommendations: <br>

Compiled a comprehensive report documenting the methodology, data sources, and findings of the forest fire risk zone mapping.
Provided recommendations for post-fire management strategies, including ecosystem restoration, erosion control measures, and future fire risk reduction. <br>
Results: <br>
The Forest Fire Risk Zone Mapping project successfully mapped the burn severity and identified forest fire risk zones in the Kangaroo Island region of Australia in December 2019. The study area was classified into distinct regions based on the severity levels of the fire, providing insights into the impact on the ecosystem and potential downstream risks. The project's outcomes aided in developing emergency rehabilitation and restoration plans, prioritizing mitigation efforts, and planning for future fire events. The information gathered through this project contributed to the understanding of fire-related risks and supported decision-making processes for post-fire management and ecosystem restoration in the Kangaroo Island region.

Objective: <br>
The objective of this project was to conduct forest fire risk zone mapping in the Brasilia region of Brazil in May 2019. The study aimed to assess the burn severity and classify the area into five regions: Unburned, Low Severity, Moderate – Low Severity, Moderate – High Severity, and High Severity. The project aimed to understand the impact of fire intensity on the ecosystem, provide data for emergency rehabilitation and restoration planning, and estimate the likelihood of future downstream impacts such as flooding, landslides, and soil erosion. <br>
<br>
Methodology: <br>

Data Collection: <br>

Collected burn severity data and maps for the Brasilia region, using sources such as satellite imagery, aerial surveys, and ground observations.
Considered dNBR (Normalized Burn Ratio) values for interpreting burn severity, understanding that field assessments may enhance specific instance interpretation. <br>
Burn Severity Analysis: <br>

Analyzed the burn severity data to assess how the fire intensity affected the functioning of the ecosystem in the burnt areas.
Examined factors such as vegetation damage, soil burn severity, and ecosystem disruption to determine the level of burn severity. <br>
Risk Zone Classification: <br>

Utilized GIS software and spatial analysis techniques to classify the study area into different forest fire risk zones based on the burn severity levels.
Identified the Unburned, Low Severity, Moderate – Low Severity, Moderate – High Severity, and High Severity regions to understand the distribution and extent of fire impacts. <br>
Post-Fire Rehabilitation and Restoration Planning: <br>

Utilized the burn severity data and risk zone maps to develop emergency rehabilitation and restoration plans for the affected areas.
Considered the burn severity levels to prioritize rehabilitation efforts and implement measures to prevent downstream impacts, such as flooding, landslides, and soil erosion. <br>
Reporting and Recommendations: <br>

Prepared a comprehensive report outlining the methodology, data sources, and findings of the forest fire risk zone mapping for Brasilia.
Provided recommendations for post-fire management strategies, including ecosystem restoration, erosion control measures, and future fire risk reduction. <br>
Results: <br>
The Forest Fire Risk Zone Mapping project successfully assessed the burn severity and classified the Brasilia region into five distinct regions based on fire intensity levels. The project provided valuable insights into the impact of fire on the ecosystem and aided in developing emergency rehabilitation and restoration plans. By estimating the likelihood of downstream impacts, such as flooding, landslides, and soil erosion, the project contributed to better understanding and mitigation of post-fire risks. The project's outcomes supported decision-making processes for post-fire management and ecosystem conservation in the Brasilia region.
