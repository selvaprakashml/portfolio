Objective: <br>
The objective of this project was to develop a computer vision-based solution to identify and detect overhead tanks in aerial images, specifically using Python libraries such as NumPy, OpenCV, and the Hough Circle Transform. The project aimed to utilize image processing techniques to recognize the shape and color of the overhead tanks, and represent them as circles along the edges in a georeferenced image. <br>

Methodology: <br>

Data Acquisition: <br>

Obtained georeferenced aerial images of the target area from Google Earth at a scale rate of 400m. <br>
Image Preprocessing: <br>

Utilized Python libraries, including NumPy and OpenCV, for image manipulation and preprocessing.
Applied image enhancement techniques to improve the quality and visibility of the overhead tanks. <br>
Object Recognition and Detection: <br>

Implemented the Hough Circle Transform algorithm to detect circular shapes corresponding to the overhead tanks.
Utilized edge detection algorithms to identify the edges of the overhead tanks in the aerial images. <br>
Parameterization and Georeferencing: <br>

Defined the detected circles using three parameters: center point (x, y) coordinates and radius.
Georeferenced the detected circles to relate them to real-world coordinates in the aerial image. <br>
Result Visualization: <br>

Generated a georeferenced circle-detected image highlighting the locations of the overhead tanks.
Represented the detected overhead tanks as circular lines along the edges of the tanks. <br>
Results: <br>
The implementation of object recognition techniques using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy enabled the successful detection and identification of overhead tanks in aerial images. The project produced a georeferenced image displaying the detected circles representing the locations of the overhead tanks. By leveraging image processing algorithms and edge detection techniques, this solution provided a practical approach for accurately identifying overhead tanks from aerial images.

This project on overhead tank detection from aerial images showcases my proficiency in computer vision, image processing, and geospatial analysis. It demonstrates my ability to leverage Python libraries like OpenCV and NumPy to extract meaningful information from georeferenced images, contributing to efficient infrastructure planning and management.
