Objective: <br>
The objective of this project was to create an integrated mapping system that combines path, inundation, and rainfall data for the Gaja cyclone in Thanjavur's coastal region in 2018. The project aimed to visually depict the cyclone's path, areas of inundation, and corresponding rainfall patterns to provide a comprehensive understanding of the cyclone's impact on the region. <br>

Methodology: <br>

Data Acquisition: <br>

Gathered the path data of the Gaja cyclone, including its track and intensity, from reliable sources or meteorological agencies.
Obtained inundation data from satellite imagery, remote sensing, or field surveys to identify the areas affected by flooding or water inundation.
Acquired rainfall data from meteorological stations or rainfall gauges in the study area to analyze the rainfall patterns during the cyclone.
<br>
Data Integration and Processing: <br>

Preprocessed and standardized the data to ensure compatibility and accuracy.
Georeferenced the path, inundation, and rainfall data to align them spatially.
Conducted spatial analysis and interpolation techniques to create continuous surfaces for inundation and rainfall data. <br>
Map Creation and Visualization: <br>

Utilized GIS software to overlay the path, inundation, and rainfall data layers.
Created thematic maps and visualizations to represent the integrated data, highlighting the spatial relationships and patterns.
Employed color coding or shading techniques to depict the severity of inundation and rainfall intensity. <br>
Data Analysis and Interpretation: <br>

Analyzed the integrated map to identify the areas most affected by the cyclone, extent of inundation, and localized rainfall patterns.
Assessed the impact on infrastructure, communities, and the environment based on the combined data analysis.
Extracted meaningful insights to inform disaster management strategies, risk assessment, and mitigation measures. <br>
Reporting and Communication: <br>

Compiled a comprehensive report detailing the methodology, data sources, and findings of the integrated mapping system.
Communicated the results effectively through visually appealing maps and data visualizations.
Presented the report to relevant stakeholders, including local authorities, disaster management agencies, and the public, to aid in decision-making and future planning. <br>
Results: <br>
The integrated mapping system successfully combined path, inundation, and rainfall data for the Gaja cyclone in Thanjavur's coastal region in 2018. The resulting maps and visualizations provided a comprehensive understanding of the cyclone's impact, including the path it took, areas affected by flooding, and localized rainfall patterns. The project's outcomes served as valuable tools for assessing the extent of damage, informing relief efforts, and guiding future disaster management strategies in the region.

This project on the integrated mapping of path, inundation, and rainfall data for the Gaja cyclone demonstrates my proficiency in GIS analysis, data integration, and visualization. It highlights my ability to utilize spatial data to understand the impact of natural disasters, communicate findings effectively through maps and visualizations, and contribute to informed decision-making in disaster management and planning.
