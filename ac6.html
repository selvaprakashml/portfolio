Objective: <br>
The objective of this project was to identify a suitable location for a dumpyard site through land sustainability mapping. The study employed overlay analysis techniques, integrating multiple spatial data layers including land use and land cover, linement, roadways, and railways. The project aimed to assess the sustainability of various areas based on these factors and determine the optimal site for the dumpyard. <br>

Methodology: <br>

Data Collection: <br>

Gathered relevant spatial data layers, including land use and land cover data, linement data, roadways data, and railway data, from reliable sources and conducted necessary preprocessing. <br>
Overlay Analysis: <br>

Utilized GIS software and overlay analysis techniques to overlay the collected spatial data layers.
Assigned weights and suitability criteria to each layer based on its significance in determining a suitable dumpyard site. <br>
Suitability Assessment: <br>

Conducted a comprehensive analysis by considering factors such as land use compatibility, proximity to linements, roadways, and railways.
Assigned suitability scores to different areas based on the overlay results, highlighting the potential locations that meet the desired criteria. <br>
Site Selection: <br>

Evaluated the overlay results and identified the areas with the highest suitability scores as potential locations for the dumpyard site.
Examined other relevant factors such as accessibility, environmental considerations, and social impact to finalize the optimal site. <br>
Result Map: <br>

Generated a result map illustrating the recommended location for the dumpyard site based on the overlay analysis.
The result map visually depicts the areas with the highest suitability for the dumpyard, providing a clear indication of the optimal site selection. <br>
Results: <br>
The Land Sustainability Mapping project successfully integrated multiple spatial data layers and conducted overlay analysis to identify a suitable location for the dumpyard site. By considering factors such as land use and land cover, linement, roadways, and railways, the project assessed the sustainability of different areas. The result map showcased the recommended location for the dumpyard, highlighting the areas with the highest suitability scores based on the overlay analysis.
