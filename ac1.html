Objective: <br>
The objective of this project was to monitor urban sprawl in Thoothukudi City over a span of two decades, specifically focusing on the years 2000, 2010, and 2020. The project aimed to analyze the land use and land cover changes to identify and assess the extent of urban sprawl within the city. <br>

Methodology: <br>

Data Acquisition: <br>

Obtained satellite imagery for Thoothukudi City for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020.
Acquired relevant spatial datasets such as road networks, administrative boundaries, and land use maps. <br>
Image Processing and Analysis: <br>

Conducted image preprocessing to enhance the quality and compatibility of the satellite imagery.
Utilized remote sensing techniques to classify land use and land cover categories.
Employed change detection algorithms to identify areas experiencing urban sprawl. <br>
Urban Sprawl Assessment: <br>

Quantified the spatial extent and magnitude of urban sprawl for each year.
Analyzed the patterns and trends of land use changes over time.
Produced thematic maps and spatial visualizations to depict the urban growth and sprawl. <br>
Findings and Recommendations: <br>

Identified areas with significant urban sprawl and expansion.
Assessed the impact of urban sprawl on the environment, infrastructure, and land use patterns.
Provided recommendations for sustainable urban planning and management to mitigate the negative effects of urban sprawl. <br>
Results: <br>
The analysis of land use and land cover changes revealed that urban sprawl was occurring consistently every year within Thoothukudi City. The project visually showcased the expansion of urban areas, conversion of agricultural or natural land to built-up areas, and the encroachment of surrounding land. These findings highlighted the urgent need for effective urban planning strategies and policies to manage urban growth and preserve valuable natural resources.

This project on urban sprawl monitoring in Thoothukudi City demonstrates my proficiency in remote sensing, spatial analysis, and urban planning. It showcases my ability to utilize GIS and remote sensing tools to assess urban sprawl patterns and provide valuable insights for sustainable urban development and management.
